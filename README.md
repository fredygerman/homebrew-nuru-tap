# Homebrew Nuru Tap

This is a Homebrew tap for the Nuru programming language.

## Installation

To use this tap, you'll need to have Homebrew installed on your macOS system. If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can do so by following the instructions at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/).

Once you have Homebrew installed, you can add this tap to your system:

```

After that, you can install the Nuru compiler:

```bash
brew install nuru
```
